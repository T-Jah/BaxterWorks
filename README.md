BW contains some scripts from other people (see credits), edited by me to fit in the project.
Other scripts are from me. I got help from the official guide and the forum(archiv).

With this work, I´ve learned some AHK. I want to go on this way, learning from the comments
in the script. I left those and made myself many new comments. Maybe it will help another
person to learn more easy. Thank you to all the people, sharing code for free.
