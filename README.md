## BaxterWorks
#### Multi-MiniTool Software
**Help**files on http://www.baxterworks.de/software/hilfe/help.htm

BaxterWorks contains *scripts from other people* (see credits), some are just edited by me to fit in the project.
Other scripts is my result. I got help from the official guide and the forum(archiv).

With this work, IÂ´ve learned some AHK. I want to go on this way, learning by doing from the comments
in the script. I left those parts untouched, but made myself many new comments. Maybe it will help others
to learn more easy. **Thank you** to all the people, sharing code.
